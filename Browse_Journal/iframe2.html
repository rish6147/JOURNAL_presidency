In this use case, APM refers to the collection and analysis of data related to the performance, availability, and user experience of the various microservices that make up the Healthcare service. APM for containerized microservice-based Healthcare services often includes the deployment of agents orinstrumentation within each containerized microservice to capture performance statistics such asCPU and memory utilization, network latency, and error rates. This data is then gathered andanalyzed to identify bottlenecks, diagnose problems, and optimize system performance. Severalframeworks and tools are utilized to move forward, including Spring boot, Maven as a projects management tool, Apache Tomcat as a web server, and MYSQL as a database. Kafka to build real-time streaming data pipelines and apps that adapt to data streams, Kibana to developvisualized dash boards, Docker for containerization, and a few APM tools to monitor applicationperformance. The suggested approach combines microservices, classified as doctor appointmentmanagement, patient appointment management, pharmacy, and billing services. The Logging Library for APM (Application Performance Monitoring) is a software componentdesigned to assist developers with a dependable and fast mechanism to log events andperformance data within their applications. The library offers several logging levels, allowingdevelopers to regulate the amount of information captured, and contains capabilities like logfiltering, formatting, and aggregate. The Logging Library for APM is meant to work in tandemwith existing APM tools, giving developers a comprehensive picture of their applications performance and behavior. Using the librarys robust logging capabilities, developers can simplyidentify and resolve faults in their applications, enhancing overall reliability and user experience. SLF4J and Logback in APM for healthcare services provide healthcare service providers with aversatile and powerful logging solution that can be adjusted to their individual requirements. Ithelps them record and analyze performance data and diagnose problems, enhancing the quality and dependability of healthcare services for patient')">View

But these techniques are not safe because they are viewed by malicious observers who use surveillance techniques such as shouldersurfing (observation of the user while typing the password through the keyboard) to capture user authentication data. Also, there are security problems due to poor interactions between systems and users.As a result, the researchers proposed a three-layered security framework to secure PIN numbers, where users can enter the password by blinking their eye at the suitable symbols in the appropriate order, and thus the user is invulnerable to shoulder surfing. Eye blinking is a natural interaction method and security systems based on eye blink tracking provide a promising solution to the system’s security and usability. The aim of this paper is to review techniques or solutions to dealing with eye blinking in security systems. The use of personal identification numbers (PINs) is a common user authentication method for many applications, such as money management in automatic teller machines (ATMs), approving electronic transactions, unlocking personal devices, and opening doors. Authentication is always a challenge even when using PIN authentication, such as in financial systems and gateway management. According to European ATM Security, fraud attacks on ATMs increased by 26% in 2016 compared to 2015. The fact that an authorized user must enter the code in open or public places makes PIN entry vulnerable to password attacks, such as shoulder surfing and thermal tracking.A camera-based eye-blinking system has been incorporated into a new application for eyelid blinK based PIN identification. The system has been successfully tested with a nine-digit keypad and can be extended to character and digit combination password entries. The stability of the user’s eye blink will affect the accuracy of the detected pins and must be accounted for. Currently, the PIN identification is accomplished after real-time eye-blinks and eye centre computations and recordings are completed')">View
